["pset8.html", "H Problem Set 8 Another overlapping-generations model with government debt", " H Problem Set 8 Another overlapping-generations model with government debt In this exercise, we consider the same problem as in lecture 10, except that lifetime utility is logarithmic with \\(\\beta = 2\\) (that is, people are patient instead of impatient, so they tend to save a lot): \\[U = \\log(c_t^y) + 2\\log(c_{t+1}^o)\\] We denote the (net) real interest rate by \\(r_t\\) so that the intertemporal budget constraint is: \\[c_{t}^{y}+\\frac{c_{t+1}^{o}}{1+r_t}=w_{t}.\\] Other than that, we still assume a Cobb-Douglas production function with \\(\\alpha = 1/3\\), so that: \\[Y_t = K_t^{1/3} L_t^{2/3}.\\] We assume that the labor force is constant so that \\(L_t=1\\). The depreciation rate is still \\(\\delta = 1 = 100\\%\\). Compute \\(c_{t+1}^o\\) and \\(c_t^y\\) as a function of the wage \\(w_t\\). What is the law of motion for the capital stock? Compute the steady-state capital stock \\(K^{*}\\), the (net) steady-state real interest rate \\(r^{*}\\), the steady-state output \\(Y^{*}\\), the steady-state wage \\(w^{*}\\), and the steady-state consumption of the young \\((c^y)^{*}\\) and of the old \\((c^o)^{*}\\). Compute the Golden Rule (net) interest rate \\(r^{*}_g\\), the Golden Rule capital stock \\(K^{*}_g\\), the Golden Rule output \\(Y^{*}_g\\), the Golden Rule wage \\(w^{*}_g\\), and the Golden Rule consumption of the young \\((c^y)^{*}_g\\) and of the old \\((c^o)^{*}_g\\). Compare the Golden Rule and steady-state levels, and give an economic intuition. What level of government debt \\(B^{*}_g\\) brings the capital stock to the Golden Rule level ? Starting from the steady-state situation of question 3, assume that the government gives this money to retirees, taking on government debt. How much is this (lucky) generation of retirees able to consume ? Why is national debt a Ponzi scheme here? Is it bad ? Assume that the government puts in place a pay-as-you-go system, such as Social Security (think of OASDI), giving retirees an amount \\(B^{*}_g\\) each period (where \\(B^{*}_g\\) is the same level of government debt as the one found in question 6), and taxing the young an equal amount \\(B^{*}_g\\). Compare this situation to question 7. What are the differences and similarities? What is the difference between pay-as-you-go financing and deficit financing ? Explain why government debt is not a very meaningful statistic. "]
