<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction to Macroeconomics</h1>
<p>GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in a country within a given period. There are two sides to GDP, the demand side and the supply side:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On the <strong>demand side</strong>, the <strong>product approach to GDP</strong> recognizes that total aggregate demand is made of four components:
<ul>
<li>Consumption spending by households (C).</li>
<li>Investment spending by households and corporations (I).</li>
<li>Government purchases (G).</li>
<li>Net exports (NX).</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach to GDP based on aggregate demand for goods will be central in lectures <a href="#cons-function"><strong>??</strong></a>, <a href="#paradox-thrift"><strong>??</strong></a>, <a href="#redistributive"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="#open"><strong>??</strong></a>. It is presented in section <a href="#gdp-product">1.1</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On the <strong>supply side</strong>, the production of output involves the use of factors of production, typically limited to capital (<span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>) and labor (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>). These factors of production receive payment for their use, whose sum equals GDP.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <strong>income approach to GDP</strong> consists in dividing up these payments into the different factors of production. Again, this often simply means a division of total value added into capital income, and labor income. It is presented in section <a href="#gdp-income">1.2</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="gdp-product" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The Product Approach to GDP</h2>
<p>GDP is equal to the total aggregate demand for goods: <span class="math display">\[ Y = C + I + G + X -M.\]</span> We often define net exports as:<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[NX \equiv X-M,\]</span> so that GDP is simply: <span class="math display">\[ Y = C + I + G + NX.\]</span></p>
<p>We examine each component of aggregate demand in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption (C): in section <a href="#cons">1.1.1</a></li>
<li>Investment (I): in section <a href="#inv">1.1.2</a></li>
<li>Government Purchases (G): in section <a href="#gov">1.1.3</a></li>
<li>Net Exports (NX): in section <a href="#net-exports">1.1.4</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="cons" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Consumption (C)</h3>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:gdp-cons">1.1</a> plots GDP from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), as well as Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), in billions of dollars. We can see that Gross Domestic Product is currently in the vicinity of $20 trillion (or $20,000 billion). For this figure, data is retrieved from <a href="https://db.nomics.world" class="uri">https://db.nomics.world</a>, a great source of macroeconomic data. For example, data for Gross Domestic Product is available <a href="https://db.nomics.world/BEA/NIPA-T10105/A191RC-Q">here</a> and data for Personal Consumption Expenditures is available <a href="https://db.nomics.world/BEA/NIPA-T10105/DPCERC-Q">there</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.1: <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">US GDP and Consumption from NIPA (BEA)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>We also note that growth of GDP and consumption is roughly exponential over time, because it looks almost linear when plotted on a <strong>log scale</strong> (for the y-axis).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>To get a better of sense of how big consumption is as a fraction to GDP (although you may eyeball it on this picture), we might plot consumption as a function of GDP, which is what I do on Figure <a href="#fig:consumption">1.3</a>. You can see that Personal Consumption Expenditures are approximately <strong>60 to 70 % of GDP</strong>. You can also see that it has been rising since the end of the sixties. We will discuss that.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.3: <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Consumption as a share of GDP from NIPA (BEA)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>Personal Consumption Expenditures are divided up into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Durable Goods (more than 3 years of durability): e.g. cars.</li>
<li>Non-durable Goods (less than 3 years of durability).</li>
<li>Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Services have become more important than Goods in total consumption since the 1970s, as Figure <a href="#fig:goods-vs-services">1.4</a> shows.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Investment (I)</h3>
<p>Investment has two components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>non residential investment</strong> is the purchase of new capital goods by firms: structures, new plants.</li>
<li><strong>residential investment</strong> is the purchase of new houses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gross private domestic investment is approximately <strong>15 to 20 % of GDP</strong>, as you can see on Figure <a href="#fig:inv">1.5</a>. It is also very volatile over the cycle.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Government Purchases (G)</h3>
<p>Government purchases are composed of purchases of goods by the government plus the compensation of government employees. Overall, they comprise about approximately 20% of GDP, as can be seen on Figure <a href="#fig:g-purchases">1.6</a>. Note however that they do not include transfers from the government of interest payments on government debt.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Income Approach to GDP</h2>
<div id="cobb-douglas-production-function" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Cobb-Douglas Production function</h3>
<p>In order to organize our thinking, let’s write out a Cobb-Douglas production function, defined as: <span class="math display">\[Y_t = A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{1-\alpha},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a number between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. We will see later that this <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is related to the share of capital versus labor in value added. In practice, you should think of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> as close to <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span>. Again, we shall explain why at the end of this lecture.</p>
<p>To proceed further, it is useful to think of a firm which would choose the amount of labor it uses <span class="math inline">\(L_t\)</span> as well as the amount of capital it uses <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> in order to maximize its profits:<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[\max_{K_t, L_t} \quad A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{1-\alpha} - R_t K_t - w_t L_t,\]</span></p>
<p>In this expression, <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is the <strong>rental rate</strong> of capital, also called the <strong>gross return</strong> to capital. This represents how much it costs to rent one unit of capital. This cost actually has two components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It includes a conventional interest rate <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span>, which is the cost of borrowing money to invest in capital. You should think of this as the real interest rate which is charged by a bank to borrow money.</p></li>
<li><p>It also includes a depreciation rate <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, which accounts for the wear and tear of the capital stock, implying that its value drops over time. If capital is bought, then the resale price for each unit of capital is lower by a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, which is a cost to the investor. If capital is rented, then capital needs to be given back to the owner in its original state.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We have that the rental rate or gross return is equal to the net return plus the depreciation rate: <span class="math display">\[\boxed{R_t = r_t + \delta}.\]</span> From Econ 11, it should be clear that a way to solve this problem is to set the derivative of the profit function equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_t\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiating with respect to <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> implies: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\alpha A_t K_t^{\alpha-1} L_t^{1-\alpha} - R_t = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{R_t = \alpha A_t K_t^{\alpha-1} L_t^{1-\alpha}}.
\end{aligned}
\]</span></li>
<li>Differentiating with respect to <span class="math inline">\(L_t\)</span> implies: <span class="math display">\[(1-\alpha) A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{-\alpha} - w_t = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{w_t = (1-\alpha) A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{-\alpha}}.\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an alternative, and more direct way to get at that same result, would be to use Econ 11 directly, and write that the marginal products have to be equal to prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>rental rate of capital</strong> <span class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> is the marginal product of capital. The marginal product of capital is how much more output is obtained when the capital stock is increased by one unit, which is just the derivative of output with respect to capital <span class="math inline">\(\partial Y_t / \partial K_t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
R_t&amp;=\frac{\partial Y_t}{\partial K_t}\\
&amp;= \frac{\partial \left(A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{1-\alpha}\right)}{\partial K_t}\\
R_t &amp;= \alpha A_t K_t^{\alpha-1} L_t^{1-\alpha}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></li>
<li>The <strong>wage</strong> <span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span> is the marginal product of labor. The marginal product of labor is how much more output is obtained when the quantity of labor is increased by one unit, which is just the derivative of output with respect to labor <span class="math inline">\(\partial Y_t / \partial L_t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
w_t &amp;=\frac{\partial Y_t}{\partial L_t}\\
&amp;= \frac{\partial \left(A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{1-\alpha}\right)}{\partial L_t}\\
w_t &amp;= (1-\alpha) A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{-\alpha}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The total capital income <span class="math inline">\(R_t K_t\)</span> is a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of output <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
R_t K_t &amp;= \alpha A_t K_t^{\alpha-1} L_t^{1-\alpha} \cdot K_t \\
&amp;= \alpha A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{1-\alpha}\\
R_t K_t &amp;= \alpha Y_t.
\end{aligned}
\]</span> This implies that the share of capital income in output (or equivalently, value added) is: <span class="math display">\[\boxed{\frac{R_t K_t}{Y_t}=\alpha}.\]</span></p>
<p>The total wage bill <span class="math inline">\(w_t L_t\)</span> is a fraction <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span> of output <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
w_t L_t &amp;= (1-\alpha) A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{-\alpha} \cdot L_t \\
&amp;= (1-\alpha) A_t K_t^{\alpha} L_t^{1-\alpha}\\
w_t L_t &amp;= (1-\alpha) Y_t
\end{aligned}
\]</span> The share of labor income in output <span class="math inline">\(w_t L_t/Y_t\)</span> (or equivalently, value added) is: <span class="math display">\[\boxed{\frac{w_t L_t}{Y_t}=1-\alpha}.\]</span></p>
<p>Note that capital income plus labor income equals total output: <span class="math display">\[R_t K_t + w_t L_t = Y_t.\]</span> Another way to say the same thing is that the share of capital income in output and that of labor income in output add up to one: <span class="math display">\[\boxed{\frac{R_t K_t}{Y_t} + \frac{w_t L_t}{Y_t}=1}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-income-side-in-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> The Income Side in the Data</h3>
<p>In practice, how much goes to the compensation of employees (labor income), and how much goes to the returns to capital (capital income)? The answer is that it goes approximately for 1/3 to capital and for 2/3 to labor. In turn, this implies that we will, in numerical applications of our theories, often assume that: <span class="math display">\[\alpha = \frac{1}{3}\]</span> The calculations for these are less straightforward than for computing the share of consumption, investment, as we did above. The reason is that in practice, the division between labor and capital is not as clear cut in the national accounts as one might hope: for example, someone who owns her/his own business reports most of her/his income in the form of capital income, even when a large part of it is actually labor income, so that compensation of employees is (vastly) understated. Figure <a href="#fig:comp-emp">1.8</a> shows which results are obtained using this understated measure. It needs to be adjusted upwards by about 10% of GDP, for the reasons mentioned above.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:comp-emp"></span>
<img src="temp_files/figure-html/comp-emp-1.pdf" alt="Compensation of Employees as a share of GDP from NIPA (BEA)." width="100%" height="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1.8: <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Compensation of Employees as a share of GDP from NIPA (BEA)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>For our purposes, we only need to remember that the share of compensation of employees is approximately 2/3 of value added: <span class="math display">\[1-\alpha \approx \frac{2}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{\alpha \approx \frac{1}{3}}.\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, we will very often work with a Cobb-Douglas production function where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=1/3\)</span>, implying that production is given by: <span class="math display">\[Y_t = A_t K_t^{1/3} L_t^{2/3}.\]</span> Lecture <a href="#solow"><strong>??</strong></a> will walk you through the Solow growth model, where we shall make heavy use of that Cobb-Douglas production function.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Note that we are assuming here that there are no “rents” in the economy, that is that nothing can be obtained without either labor or capital. This is not exactly true, as for example oil is clearly more valuable than the costs of extracting it for the soil.

It is a good first-order approximation however, as most production in fact requires either labor of capital.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
